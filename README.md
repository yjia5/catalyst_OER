# catalyst_OER
This repository contains the shell scripts to do the OER energy diagram calculation

## Step 1:
Relax the structure of *, *OH, *O and *OOH

## Step 2:
Calculate the phonon of absorbate of *OH, *O, *OOH

## Step 3:
Grep results of E0 (Internal energy of zero-temperature) and entropy correction based on phonon calculation

## Step 4:
Use the jupyter notebook to plot the energy diagram
